            <p>I'm a prospective web developer located in the Logan Square neighborhood of Chicago Illinois. <br>Currently enrolled in Thinkful's Software Engineering Bootcamp.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I’ve always been a problem solver, which is why web development excites me so much!	
          <br>
        I grew up on a farm, have had a varied professional career that includes:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>farmhand</li>
        <li>barista</li>
        <li>seafood department manager</li>
        <li>business to business tech consultant</li> 
        </ol>
        <p>As well as some other odds and ends that fill out a breadth of experience that any team would benefit from. 
        <br>
        During my professional life I was put to task on challenging problems in a plethora of fields, worked with varied people on a variety of goals, and had businesses relying on me to uncover and remedy hidden cost centers. 
        <br>
        That experience has provided me with an aptitude for thinking outside of the box, and with web development I get to help companies meet and exceed their bottom line in a creative and enjoyable manner.
        <br>
        Aside from my professional life I’m a cat-dad, spend way too much time on Warhammer 40k, and play bass and sing back up for a local Chicago band called The Phones – we’re sort of like if Elton John and the Misfits collaborated (punk rock piano bops being our calling card).
